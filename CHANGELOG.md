[For downloads check the releases page](https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue/releases)

*This is a beta version. The browser addons are not updated yet, and the `:latest` tag of the docker image still points
to the previous stable version.*

This release is a complete rewrite of elasticvue in vue 3. I also switched from vue-cli to vite, from vuetify to quasar
and used typescript. Elasticvue received a lot of improvements, fixes and new features, some of the most notable are:

**New features**

* Setup: improved setup page with ability to directly import an elasticvue backup
* Home: improved dashboard with more cluster information
* Cluster management: ability to change cluster credentials
* Indices: can reindex indices into other indices and delete all documents from and index
* Search: you can now edit documents on the search page directly. Also adds a setting to localize `@timestamp` values.
* Rest: completely rewritten. Now includes tabs, history, saved queries - all saved separately per cluster.
* Snapshots: can create s3 repositories.
* New theme
* Improved desktop version
* Huge performance improvements
* Ability to use comments in search query and rest request bodies `// some comment`

**Fixes**

This release includes many, many bugfixes. Some were fixed intentionally and many where fixed by upgrading to vue 3 and
quasar.

**Removed features**

* Nodes grid view
* Rest query vertical view
* Support for numbers bigger then `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
* Utilities (these are now included in the rest query examples)

## 0.35.0

## 0.20.0

This version removes the need to configure CORS **if you use one of the browser extensions**. I am not entirely happy
with this change, but after some discussion ([#14][i14], [#17][p17]) i think we i should prioritize usability in this
case.

**You still have to configure CORS if you use the docker image or the web version of elasticvue.**
